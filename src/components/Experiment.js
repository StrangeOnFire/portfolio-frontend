      “pride”. It has ten to forty lions in it. Out of them, only one or two are
      adult males while the rest include lionesses and cubs. Usually, the males
      of the pride protect the cubs and the group against other animals and the
      females go out to hunt. Lions are very protective of their pride and are
      very ferocious animals with brilliant hunting abilities. Behaviour In this
      essay on lions for Class 3 and 4 kids, it must be mentioned that lions
      sleep for twelve to fourteen hours during the daytime and go hunting at
      night. Lions have very sharp eyesight and are, therefore, excellent
      hunters. Their sharp claws and strong paws help them to hunt animals for
      their food. Lions eat the flesh of other animals and they are very fast
      runners. The loud roaring of lions could be heard from a distance of 8
      kilometers. Among all the cat species, only lions are socially active.
      Prides typically consist of two males, seven females, and any number of
      cubs. Lionesses usually belong to a group of sisters or cousins who have
      been living together since birth. In mature females, the height at the
      shoulder is around four feet, the weight is about 450 pounds, the length
      is approximately eight and a half feet plus its tail. As a result, females
      are considerably smaller and weigh around 300 pounds on average. In
      southern Africa, coated lions are sometimes seen, but these are not true
      albinos. Common albinos have a light brown or dark brown plain coat, with
      no spots or markings. During the age of five, the male lion reaches sexual
      maturity, whereas the female lion reaches maturity when she is four. In
      pride, lionesses usually are brought together during the breeding season
      and later give birth together, allowing them to share nursing duties. An
